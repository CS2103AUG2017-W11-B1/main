== Welcome to Contact Plus
Contact Plus is a contact-managing service through command line. We strive to provide the very comprehensive services for busy students on the campus so that they can manage their contacts efficiently. For example, the auto-correction feature allows
our busy friend - David, a university student, to type fast on the keyboard without worrying spelling mistakes.

This guide will help you get familiar with the features of Contact Plus application.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.

[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
