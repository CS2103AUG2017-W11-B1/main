*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/zhangshuoyang.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/zhangshuoyang.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Add Tasks

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=addtask]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The `addtask` feature allows users to manage their tasks within the address book application, instead of switching
between different apps. It offers a place for the to-do list to be stored, managed and organised. This feature will
not do your tasks for you, but it is powerful enough to get you started.

Once the task is successfully added, it will be displayed on the sticky note in the `Task` tab, as shown below:

=== Enhancement Added: Theme Selection

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=themeselect]

#End of Extract#

---
==== Justification

The `select theme` feature allows users to choose their favourite theme from the default set of themes available.
It allows users to have a more personalised address book.

After a theme is selected, the user interface will be updated immediately. For instance, after switching to Light Theme,
the following result will be displayed.

=== Enhancement Proposed: command `sync`

`Sync` command allows users to sync their local contact lists with *Google Contacts* and save their changes online. +
*Format*: `sync all` or `sync 1/2/3` or `sync 1` +
*Note*: Implement in the future

==== Description
*********
* Users must log in to Google before they can use `sync` command.
* After logging in to Google, users can choose the list of contacts they want to synchronise.
* For instance, `sync 1` refers to sync the contact of Index 1 in the person list, while `sync all` refers to all the contacts in the list.
* Multiple contacts can be selected by inputting multiple Indexes, separating by `/`. For instance, `sync 1/2/3` refers to synchronising contacts of Index 1, 2 and 3.
*********

==== Implementation
. After the command word `sync` is typed, `execute()` function in `LogicManager` will be called.
. The command line will be passed to `AddressBookParser` which returns `SyncCommandParser`, and subsequently a `SyncCommand` object.
. The command will post an event to the `EventCenter`, which is handled by an `OAuth` class.
. The `OAuth` class is used to request for authorisations and interact with *Google Contacts*.
. An instance will be created to perform relevant actions on *Google Contacts* and sync the contact list.
