<p>Contact Plus is a command-line based contact-managing application used for busy students on campus as well as anyone who needs a contact-managing application. In addition to the management of contacts, this application '
can be served as a task-managing application as well. The user interacts with this application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.</p>

</p><p class="tableblock">---
</p><p class="tableblock">==== Justification
</p><p class="tableblock">1. Inevitably the command could be too long for users to memorise. With alias, the need for memorization of each command word is saved. Alias allows
users to simply memorize one or two alphabets to perform the feature on the application.
</p><p class="tableblock">2. Alias is much shorter than its corresponding command words, therefore it is more efficient to use than to use the command. Alias helps users to use the application efficiently.
</p><p class="tableblock">3. As alias improves efficiency and saves users from heavy memorization. It contributes to user-friendliness aspect of this application.
</p><p class="tableblock">==== Implementation
</p><p class="tableblock">---
Alias Mechanism
</p><p class="tableblock">Alias in this application is a single alphabet or two alphabets. This purpose of alias is to save the labor of typing the full corresponding command words, therefore it is more efficient and easier to use.
The alias mechanism is implemented in <code>AddressBookParser</code>, and its logic can be described by the following activity diagram:
</p><p class="tableblock"><span class="image"><img src="../images/AliasActivityDiagram.png" alt="AliasActivityDiagram" width="800"></span>
</p><p class="tableblock">1. <code>AddressBookParser</code> receives the input argument from users.<br>
2. If the input argument is an alias, the corresponding command instance is created and command is processed.<br>
3. If the input argument is a command word, the command instance is created, and the command is processed.
</p><p class="tableblock">The code snippet is shown as follows:
[source,java]
----
case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD: case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD_ALIAS:
            return new AddCommandParser().parse(arguments);
----
</p><p class="tableblock">==== Design Consideration
</p><p class="tableblock"><strong>Aspect:</strong> Length of an alias
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Use one or two alphabets to represent a command, usually it is the first alphabet of its corresponding command word.
<strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to memories the alias as it is the first letter of the command word.
<strong>Cons:</strong> May be confusing when some command requires two alphabets for alias. This is because there will be overlapping alias when two command words have the same first letter.
</p><p class="tableblock"><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use a fixed length of three alphabets for every alias.
<strong>Pros:</strong> The length for each alias is unformed.
<strong>Cons:</strong> Three alphabets would be too long for commands like <code>add</code>.
</p><p class="tableblock">=== Enhancement Added:  Locating groups by tag: search + tag name [Since v1.1]

* Only full tag name will be accepted, e.g. <code>friends</code> will not match <code>fri</code>
* Result displays "Unknown tag" if no person has the tag
* Alias for "search" is "st"
* Persons&#8217;s tag names matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. <code>OR</code> search). e.g. <code>friends colleague</code> will return persons with <code>friends</code>, or <code>colleague</code> tag

<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Allow multiple tags to be entered by users
<strong>Pros:</strong> Increases the flexibility of this search by tag feature. There would be no restriction on the number of tags to be entered. Users can specify as many valid tags as they want to.
<strong>Cons:</strong> May not be obvious to users that they can enter multiple tag names.

It is often a problem that to ask users to retype their misspelt words. It would be a great feature if the application can autoCorrect these mistakes and allow users to use the application smoothly.
</p><p class="tableblock">==== Implementation
</p><p class="tableblock">AutoCorrect Mechanism
</p><p class="tableblock">The <code>AutoCorrect</code> feature enables misspelt commands entered by users to be autoCorrected by the application,
and perform the correct command. The correction of the misspelt command is based on four types of prediction of the misspelt words, namely, addition of alphabets, deletion
of alphabets, transposing of alphabets and Substitution of alphabets. For the sake of efficiency, the <a href="#edit-distance">edit distance</a> is limited to 2 (refer to <code>editDistance1</code>, and <code>checkMisspeltWords</code>).
</p><p class="tableblock">The logic flow of <code>AutoCorrect</code> can be loosely described by the following <span class="image"><img src="
</p><p class="tableblock">image:AutoCorrectFlow.png" alt="
</p><p class="tableblock">image:AutoCorrectFlow" width="800"></span>
</p><p class="tableblock">This is an example of how the misspelt words are predicted by adding one more alphabet:
[source,java]
----
        for (int i = 0; i &#8656; formattedWord.length(); i) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; alphabet.length(); j) {
                String newWord = formattedWord.substring(0, i) + alphabet.charAt(j)
                        + formattedWord.substring(i, formattedWord.length());
                results.add(newWord);
            }
        }
----
</p><p class="tableblock">Auto-Correct is only utilized in <code>AddressBoonParser</code> class to check each input command, and correct the misspelt command which has an <a href="#edit-distance">edit distance</a> smaller than or equal to 2.
The following diagram shows the interaction between <code>AutoCorrect</code> and <code>AddressBookParser</code> class:
</p><p class="tableblock">image::AddressBookParser.SequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
</p><p class="tableblock">==== Prerequisites/Dependencies
</p><p class="tableblock">* The <code>COMMAND_WORD</code> for every available command must be added to the <code>getCommandPool</code> method for the command to be auto-corrected.
* AutoCorrect will only work for misspelt words within <a href="#edit-distance">edit distance</a> of 2.
* AutoCorrect is based on four types of prediction of misspelt words, namely, addition, deletion, switch, and substitution.
* Alias will not be autoCorrected as it consists only one or two alphabets.
* The logic for autoCorrecting commands is implemented in AutoCorrectCommand class.
</p><p class="tableblock">==== Design Consideration
</p><p class="tableblock"><strong>Aspect:</strong> Implementation of <code>AutoCorrect</code><br>
</p><p class="tableblock"><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Consider edit distance is 2 and the command is predicted based on the first alphabet.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> The speed of searching is improved by implementing matching command by the first alphabet as the first alphabet entered by users is often correct.
Edit distance 2 allows a considerable number of commands to be corrected by the application.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> The prediction by first alphabet limits the autoCorrection on those commands that have first alphabet wrong.
Edit distance 2 does not cover many other misspelt commands.<br>
</p><p class="tableblock"><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Read all the available file from an external file when the application begins.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> It would be easier for developers to maintain the autoCorrect feature as it is easier to update new commands into a file rather than in a method.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> It would not be able to utilise <code>COMMAND_WORD</code> defined in each command class
as it is a good practice to reused what is already defined and extend its usage (Close to modification and Open to extension Principle).<br>

</p><p class="tableblock">The Yahoo weather information display is aided by the external library "yahoo-weather-java-api:2.0.2". This library queries data from Yahoo Weather API, and the application display the information returned by calling the library functions with
a simple string parser method to format the data return. The formatted data is displayed on the <code>StatusFooterBar</code>.<br>
</p><p class="tableblock">The query of weather information is closely related to the location. The location is specified by WOEID, so in this application we take the <a href="#WOEID">WOEID</a> of Singapore by default.<br>

* The <code>deleteTask()</code> method in model must be able to accept a <code>ReadOnlyTask</code> as input and
delete it from the address book.
